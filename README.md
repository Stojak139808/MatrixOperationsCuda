# MatrixOperationsCuda

Matrixgpu object allows to execute matrix operations which are:
  multiplication by matrix,
  multiplication by scalar, 
  addition, 
  substraction, 
  transposition, 
  hadamard product,
  fill,
  randomize
on GPU using CUDA.
Matrix object allows to execute same operations as Matrixgpu, but on CPU

Both objects can do these operations on any arbitrary sized, MxN matrices.
